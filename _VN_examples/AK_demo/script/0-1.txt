<c>Guard
This is the last one!

<c>Reunion Member
Ugh!

<nar>
The last of the Reunion forces are dispatched.

<c>Guard
Target eliminated. The enemy squad is retreating!
Dr. {nickname}'s commands were perfect, just like Amiya said. How reassuring!

<c>Amiya
See, that wasn't too bad, right?
Doctor, compared to everything you've been through, this is a walk in the park.

<c>Reunion Member
*cough*...Why are you here... You're not from Ursus...
We won't... let you get in the way of our duties!

<nar>
Someone lashes the dying Reunion soldier with a whip, finishing them off.

<c>???
Don't even think about it!

<c>Guard
Instructor!

<c>Dobermann
What are you spacing out for? You almost got yourself killed!

<c>Guard
I'm... I'm sorry!

<c>Dobermann
Quick! Get back into formation!

<c>Guard
Yessir!

<c>Amiya
Dobermann! You made it!

<c>Dobermann
It's an emergency. My team was attacked by Reunion as well.
I rushed over to join you as soon as I could.

<c>Amiya
Why would Reunion attack us...?

<c>Dobermann
An organization made up of the Infected... I've always thought they were a bit extreme...
...and now they've resorted to violence, and in an Ursus city no less? That's a death wish.
The situation is only going to get more chaotic from here on out.
Amiya, we need to leave Chernobog right now.

<c>Amiya
Okay. We've already rescued the Doctor, so we can retreat according to plan.

<c>Dobermann
...And this is Dr. {nickname}?

<c>Amiya
Yes.

<c>Dobermann
Dr. {nickname}, you probably don't know who I am, but you know Amiya. For your safety...

<c>Amiya
No, no...
Um, Dobermann, Doctor isn't doing very well right now.
To put it simply, Doctor... has amnesia.

<c>Dobermann
Amnesia?
...What are you going to do now? Weren't you planning to transfer leadership to—

<c>Amiya
Doctor still has the capacity to command.
...At least, I've confirmed that from the previous battle.

<c>Dobermann
...
I can't bring myself to trust a stranger so easily.
But I trust you, Amiya.

<c>Amiya
...I understand.

<c>Dobermann
Dr. {nickname}, I am Dobermann, captain of Op Team E1.
We are going to escort you from Chernobog, which is the Ursus city we're currently in, back to Rhodes Island.

<c>Dobermann
We're in an abandoned facility in Chernobog and should now head west.

<c>Amiya
But... since we're cut off from Dr. Kal'tsit, Dobermann and I have lead our separate teams westward to a rendezvous point before confirming our signal to retreat.
That is, assuming everything goes according to plan.

<c>Dobermann
It'd be nice if things went that smoothly.
Today is our last opportunity to get you out of here, Dr. {nickname}.
But... I have a bad feeling about this.

<c>Medic
A-Amiya!

<c>Amiya
What's the matter?

<c>Medic
It's... it's a call from Rhodes Island!

<c>Amiya
Are our communications back on? Is it Dr. Kal'tsit...?

<c>???
Sorry, but not quite.

<i>PRTS_Call.png

<nar>
Amiya answers the call.

<c>Amiya
PRTS...?

<c>PRTS
The Emergency Neural Connection Request System was activated.
Interference has also been detected from Rhodes Island's end, and only partial Neural Network connection is possible.
Currently unable to establish communication with Kal'tsit, who has yet to return to Rhodes Island.
Your safety is confirmed; therefore, my mission is now complete.

<c>Dobermann
This piece of...
Do we really have time for this...?

<c>PRTS
If you do not need to connect to Rhodes Island, communication will be severed momentarily.
I am sincerely sorry for having interrupted your party.

<c>Amiya
Wait, wait! Don't hang up, I need your help still.
Dobermann, Doctor still needs some assistance.

<c>Dobermann
I know, but make it quick.

<c>Amiya
Doctor, PRTS is also one of our... partners. It will show you what to do next.
Time is of the essence, so I'm going to reconnect you to the Rhodes Island backup system.
This way, we'll have an edge in battle.
It's different from giving verbal commands and might be a bit hard to get used to, but once you learn how to use it, the entire operation will be much smoother.
...Please trust me. Just like how you used to.
PRTS... Let's start.

<c>PRTS
Identity verification required. Select verification method.

<c>Amiya
Ah, Doctor... Please say something.

<c>Doctor
(Speak)

<c>PRTS
I am not sure why you did not speak, but the action of touching the interface is sufficient—
—Fingerprint match found. Verification complete. Security clearance: 8

Welcome home, Dr. {nickname}.
